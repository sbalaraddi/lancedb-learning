# LanceDB Learning Path

Welcome to your LanceDB tutorial! This repository contains step-by-step examples to master LanceDB.

## 📚 Learning Structure

### Part 1: Fundamentals
- `01_basic_operations.py` - CRUD operations, basic queries
- `02_vector_search.py` - Understanding embeddings and similarity search
- `03_filtering_queries.py` - Advanced filtering and SQL-like queries

### Part 2: Advanced Features
- `04_indexing.py` - ANN indexes for performance
- `05_full_text_search.py` - FTS and hybrid search
- `06_versioning.py` - Data versioning and time-travel

### Part 3: Real-World Applications
- `07_rag_system.py` - Build a complete RAG pipeline
- `08_semantic_search.py` - Semantic search application
- `09_best_practices.py` - Production patterns and optimization

## 📖 Reference Document

**`LANCEDB_REFERENCE.md`** - Complete reference guide with:
- All API methods and parameters
- Best practices and patterns
- Troubleshooting guide
- Quick reference cheat sheet

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Examples in Order
```bash
python 01_basic_operations.py
python 02_vector_search.py
# ... continue through the examples
```

### 3. Keep Reference Handy
Open `LANCEDB_REFERENCE.md` in VS Code for quick lookups while coding.
